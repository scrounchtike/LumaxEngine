// Top priority

1. [ ] Clock / Profiler for performance monitoring and FPS counting
2. [ ] Move mesh3D render calls into the Renderer class for better control/optimization

1. [ ] Implement ZBuffer enable / disable in DX11 rendering context
2. [ ] Implement cleanUp function for OpenGL Model2D (delete GL buffers)
3. [ ] Implement cleanUpGeometries in OopenGL RendererGL class (delete GL buffers)
4. [ ] Implement cleanUpGeometries in DirectX 11 RendererDX111 class (delete DX11 buffers)
5. [ ] Make getWidth() and getHeight() functions in main.hpp

6. [ ] Implement getHeadPointer() in matrices another way! Recreating a float* matrix is not efficient..
7. [ ] Make the level loader respect a specific order for drawing objects: latest added objects should be drawn last
8. [ ] Make Models 2D and 3D not virtual classes! Adds slowness to engine, use #ifdef to check which model to use
9. [ ] Make the renderers functions not virtual! Causes slowness we need not.

// Less important

1. [ ] Add Resizing option to Window.hpp interface
2. [ ] Add better way to specify clear buffer color
3. [ ] Add way to check inputs without DirectInput in Win32 window class
4. [ ] Add texture description for 1. texture creation and 2. texture uniforms
5. [ ] Remove all this->... assignments to initialization lists of constructors
6. [ ] Make sure the ar variable in initializeGeometries of Renderers (GL and DX11) are using defined WIDTH and HEIGHT constants.

// Features

1. [ ] Ability to change screen coordinates: NDC(-1.0 to 1.0) or pixels(0 to size) or shifted NDC (0.0 to 1.0)
2. [ ] Transforms for points / lines / sprites


// TODO 20th june 2018

1.  [ X ] Add support for subroutines in shaders
		1.1 [ X ] Automatic queries of subroutine uniforms
		1.2 [   ] Way to set subroutines variables in lua scripting (i.e. not having to hardcode string values in rendering code)
2.  [ X ] Add support for shader pipelines for 2 (or more) shaders (Program staging)
2.5 [   ] Fix program staging and subroutines bug
3.  [ X ] Add querying of normal uniforms (get rid of ShaderLoader)
4.1 [ X ] Add 2D instanced rendering
4.2 [   ] Add 3D instanced rendering
5.  [   ] Add Indirect Draw Calls to speed up driver-GPU connection (No OSX support -- so postpone?)
6.  [   ] Add blending / ordering / sorting support
7.  [   ] Frustum Culling
8.  [   ] Occlusion Culling (Indirect draw calls + GPU queries) (Portals)
9.  [   ] Switch Model / Mesh names in engine
10. [   ] Support for FullMeshes or scene graph (maybe both?)
11. [   ] Add deferred shading support
12. [   ] Add support for normal mapping
13. [   ] Add support for parallax mapping
14. [   ] Physically Based Rendering shaders
15. [   ] ECS
